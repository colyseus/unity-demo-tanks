# Turn Based Tanks Demo

![Lobby](/demo/turn-based-tanks/WeaponFired.png)

The goal of this demo is to serve as an example of one approach to an asynchronous, turn based game using Colyseus.
This demo is designed to work with Colyseus version 0.14.5 and [Unity version 2019.4.20f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

**[Download demo](https://github.com/colyseus/unity-demo-shooting-gallery/archive/master.zip)** ([View source code](https://github.com/colyseus/unity-demo-shooting-gallery/))

## Getting Started

### Launching a local server

You need to install and launch the server from the provided Server directory for this demo to function properly. Simply follow the instructions found underneath [&quot;Running the demo server&quot; in the Unity3d section of these docs](https://docs.colyseus.io/getting-started/unity3d-client/#running-the-demo-server).

### ColyseusSettings ScriptableObject

All server settings can be changed via the ColyseusSetting ScriptableObject located here:

![ScriptableObject](../Images/scriptable-object.png)

If you are running a local server, the default settings should be sufficient, however if you wish to host a server you will need to change the Colyseus Server Address and Colyseus Server Port values accordingly.

## Demo Overview

### Room Metadata

This demo makes use of the room&#39;s metadata to track the players in the game with their username. When a player joins or creates a room their username will be stored in a property called either &quot; **team0**&quot; or &quot; **team1**&quot; where &quot; **team0**&quot; represents the player that created the room and &quot; **team1**&quot; represents the player that has joined an available room to challenge the creator.

The usernames set in the metadata are then used to filter the available rooms displayed in the lobby. Within the lobby users are able to see any rooms they have created or are available based on whether the room is waiting for a challenger to join the game. Rooms that you have not created and have two players will not be shown in the lobby.

### Keeping the Room Alive

In order to make this demo an asynchronous turn based game we need to keep the room alive even after both players have left the room. The room is kept alive by setting the &quot; **autoDispose**&quot; flag to false. (You can see this in the TanksRoom server code within the onCreate handler).

We know to disconnect the room after the boolean flag &quot;inProcessOfQuitingGame&quot; has been set true and all users have been removed from the &quot;room.state.networkedUsers&quot; collection.

### Pausing the Room

When a user connects to the room there is a counter called &quot;connectedUsers&quot; that gets incremented. Inversely it gets decremented when a user has disconnected from the room. When &quot;connectedUsers&quot; is zero the intervals to update the simulation and to send patch updates effectively get paused by setting the delays to a high value. In this case the value is a little more than 24 days.

### Playing the Demo

Start the player in the scene &quot;TanksLobby&quot; located at `Assets\TurnBasedTanks\Scenes\TanksLobby`. Input your username and create a room to begin. If you cannot reach the room creation screen, confirm your local server is working properly and check the Unity Editor for error logs. If you are successful, the client will load the &quot;TankArena&quot; scene.

- This demo is an asynchronous turn based game.

- You can leave a room at any point and later return to a game in progress and it will pick up where it last left off.

- Only two players can play in a game.

- Goal being to destroy your opponent&#39;s tank.

- Each player has 3 Hit Points displayed in the top corners of the screen.

- When you create a room you can immediately take your turn without another player having joined yet.

- All controls are displayed in the ESC menu.

- You have the ability to leave the room at any time using the Exit option in the ESC menu, or you can Surrender the game to your opponent.

- You have 3 Action Points for your turn. Moving left/right consumes one AP and firing consumes two AP.

- Movement can be blocked by terrain that is too tall.

- To fire your tank&#39;s weapon you left click with the mouse and hold to charge the shot. Releasing the left mouse will fire.

- You have 3 weapons of varying range to choose from. Select your weapon with the 1-3 numbered keys.

- Between each movement or firing action there is a 2 second delay before another action can be taken.

- When a game ends due to a player&#39;s tank getting destroyed, or someone surrendering, a game over menu, showing a win/loss message, will be displayed with the options to either request a rematch or to quit the game. If the other player requests a rematch before you leave, a message will be displayed on the game over menu.

- There is an &quot;online indicator&quot; next to your opponents name to signal whether they are in the room at the same time with you. Red = offline and Green = online.

- You have the option to skip your remaining turn by pressing the SPACEBAR.

## Adjusting the Demo

As you play around with this demo, you may want to make some adjustments to better familiarize yourself with what is happening. Below, you&#39;ll learn how to make these minor adjustments.

### Game Rules and Weapon Data

Both the Game Rules and Weapon Data values can be found in the server code at ArenaServer\src\rooms\customLogic\gameRules.ts. The **Game Rules** control movement and firing costs as well as how many action points players get. The **Weapon Data** specifies the max charge, charge time, impact radius, and impact damage of each weapon.

## Events the Client Utilizes

- OnRoomStateChanged
- OnInitialSetup
- OnPlayerMove
- OnReceivedFirePath
- OnSelectedWeaponUpdated
- OnTurnCompleted
- OnPlayerJoined
- OnPlayerQuit
- OnPlayerLeave

### OnRoomStateChanged

We subscribe to this event so we can update the aim angle of the tank belonging to our opponent and get the general message updated in the room on the server.

In this demo the general message is primarily used to just display whether a player would like to challenge you to a rematch.

### OnInitialSetup

This is a custom callback that gets called when you join a room. Through it, data is provided to get your client situated and matching the state on the server: Your player turn Id is assigned, you get the current player turn, the current player&#39;s remaining Action Points, the player names, current player Hit Points, your currently selected weapon (which defaults to the short range when you connect), the map matrix for the terrain, and a bool flag for whether your opponent is currently in the room with you.

### OnPlayerMove

This is a custom callback that gets called any time you or your opponent has moved. When you want to move your tank your input is sent to the server as a move request and if your tank is able to be moved this callback is fired. Data passed to the callback includes the Id of the player that moved, their remaining Action Points, and the position to which they have moved to.

### OnReceivedFirePath

This is a custom callback that gets called when the server sends a new fire path. When you fire your weapon a request is sent to the server including barrel position and direction, along with the cannon charge value. The server then calculates the path the projectile should take using that data. The server then sends data back to both clients to this callback. Data in the callback includes the Id of the player that fired, their remaining Action Points, the path of the projectile, and damage data for terrain that gets destroyed by the projectile or any players that have been affected such as position change and remaining Hit Points after being damaged.

### OnSelectedWeaponUpdated

This is a custom callback that gets called when you have changed your selected weapon. When you want to change your weapon a request is made to the server, and if your weapon is changed successfully this callback will get fired along with the data of your selected weapon.

### OnTurnCompleted

This is a custom callback that gets called when a player&#39;s turn has completed whether they have run out of Action Points or they have skipped their remaining turn.

### OnPlayerJoined

This is a custom callback that gets called when the other player has joined the room. This is used to update the displayed player name and to toggle their online indicator.

### OnPlayerQuit

This is a custom callback that gets fired when the other player has surrendered in an incomplete game. Through this callback we get the player name so we can display it in the game over menu.

### OnPlayerLeave

This is a custom callback that gets fired when a player has exited the room and not when they have surrendered the game. We simply use this to toggle the online indicator off.
